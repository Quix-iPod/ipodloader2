Quix's edit:
Because I'm too lazy to figure out why my config file isn't working. So, I just made this colored red by default. Feel free to use it. If I can figure out how to compile it I'll add a pre-compiled version here. That is all. (December 1, 2020)

Also, I plan to add a bin file for the bootloader. I personally use iPodEditor (Mac only application) to add bootloaders since you only need the bin, and iPodEditor takes care of the installation. It is really simple. Here is the link to download iPodEditor: https://mrgeckosmedia.com/applications/info/iPodEditor

Overview:
Loader2 & iPodPatcher / SansaPatcher
- This is the main bootloader for iPodLinux. It is capable
  of loading both the iPodLinux kernel and the original
  Apple OS as well as Rockbox. It is installed via Rockbox's
  ipodpatcher tool.
- Loader2 can be configured and customized. See the
  "loader.cfg" file.
- Rockbox can also be installed by extracting the latest
  Rockbox build directly to the iPod and editing the
  "loader.cfg" file.
- SansaLinux version uses pre-built sansapatcher files
  that are patched to load SansaLinux. The files currently
  used are from the original SansaLinux release. Much of
  the below information does not apply.
For more information, see:
- http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Loader2
- http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/IpodPatcher
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader

Usage:
- Since Loader2 is a bootloader written from scratch,
  it has its own special syntax.
- For proper usage of Loader2 and its various options/syntax,
  see the provided "loader.cfg" file as well as
  the iPodLinux wiki page: http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Loader2
- The iPodLinux kernel accepts most standard kernel arguments;
  see "/docs/kernel/Original/kernel-parameters.txt"
- Loader2 has also been patched to play a boot tune on startup.
  The default boot tune should be familiar to Final Fantasy
  gamers ; )
